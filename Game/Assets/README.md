### General Graphics Styleguide:
- Follow the games setting of medieval fantasy and use appropriate references when needed.
- Low polygon vector design.
- Low amount of detail, with very sparse small decorations.
- One or two base colors with at maximum one additional color for small decorations.


#### Character Styleguide:
- Color value/luminance variations for distance from viewpoint.
- Graphics designed from an isometric view.
- ArcherCharacter is the general character body base/proportion to expand on.
- For squashing (when possible) shorten the characters legs first to retain general appearance.
- The completed design has to be squashed to an aspect of roughly 1:2 and still look alright.
